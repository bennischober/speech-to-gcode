alarm:1;Hard limit;Hard limit has been triggered. Machine position is likely lost due to sudden halt. Re-homing is highly recommended.
alarm:2;Soft limit;Soft limit alarm. G-code motion target exceeds machine travel. Machine position retained. Alarm may be safely unlocked.
alarm:3;Abort during cycle;Reset while in motion. Machine position is likely lost due to sudden halt. Re-homing is highly recommended.
alarm:4;Probe fail;Probe fail. Probe is not in the expected initial state before starting probe cycle when G38.2 and G38.3 is not triggered and G38.4 and G38.5 is triggered.
alarm:5;Probe fail;Probe fail. Probe did not contact the workpiece within the programmed travel for G38.2 and G38.4.
alarm:6;Homing fail;Homing fail. The active homing cycle was reset.
alarm:7;Homing fail;Homing fail. Safety door was opened during homing cycle.
alarm:8;Homing fail;Homing fail. Pull off travel failed to clear limit switch. Try increasing pull-off setting or check wiring.
alarm:9;Homing fail;Homing fail. Could not find limit switch within search distances. Try increasing max travel, decreasing pull-off distance, or check wiring.
alarm:10;Homing fail;Homing fail. Second dual axis limit switch failed to trigger within configured search distance after first. Try increasing trigger fail distance or check wiring.
